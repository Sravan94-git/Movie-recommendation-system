üé¨ Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis
üìå Project Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System enhanced with Sentiment Analysis of user reviews. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that only consider ratings, this system analyzes the sentiments of user reviews to generate more meaningful movie scores.

The dataset contains five sentiment categories:

Positive

Somewhat Positive

Neutral

Somewhat Negative

Negative

üìä Novelty:
A custom formula is designed to calculate the final movie rating based on the weighted contribution of these five sentiment classes, making the recommendation more reliable and realistic.

‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

The workflow of the project can be summarized as:

Web Scraping

Extracts movie reviews from IMDb using BeautifulSoup.

Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction

Cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (TfidfVectorizer).

Model Training

Machine Learning model: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

Rating Calculation

Sentiment scores are combined using the custom rating formula.

Web Application

Flask-based web app where users can:

Enter/select a movie

View scraped reviews with sentiment classification

See overall sentiment distribution & calculated rating

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python 3

Web Framework: Flask

Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (SVC, TfidfVectorizer)

Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn

API: TMDB API (for fetching movie details like posters, metadata)

üöÄ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository

1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis


2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up TMDB API Key

Create an account at TMDB
.

4. Generate your API key.

Replace the placeholder inside main.py with your key.

api_key = "YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"


5. Pretrained Model Files

nlp_model.pkl ‚Üí Trained SVC classifier

transform.pkl ‚Üí Pre-fitted TfidfVectorizer

‚úÖ These files are already included in the repo.
If you want to retrain the model:

Delete these .pkl files

Open and run Movie_Reviews_Classification.ipynb

New .pkl files will be generated

6. Run the Flask Web Application

python main.py
